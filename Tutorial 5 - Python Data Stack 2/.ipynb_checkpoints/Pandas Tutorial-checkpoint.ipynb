    "Pandas is an open source project that provides Python with some very much welcomed data structures that make data anlaysis far easier. If you've worked with R before, you know precisely what a dataframe is and have a general sense of how to get around one. If you haven't, don't worry! The goal of this session is to get you up to speed with using Pandas in Python. It takes some getting used to at first but after a little time, it should start to make some sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term dataframe is a little nebulous and offputting if you're new to this sort of thing but in reality a dataframe is nothing more than what you're use to seeing in Excel. (Okay, so this isn't entirely true. Pandas does offer a great deal more than what Excel does but the general idea stands. Dataframes can be thought of as tables in Excel more or less when you're getting started)\n",

    "Another common data science task is dealing with data imputation. There are a massive variety of ways to deal with missing values. This section will not be comprehensive in any way but will at least make you aware of this common necessity. If you have any missing values in your data (which you likely will at some point), you'll need to make a decision. Do you delete the data (possibly losing valuable information) or do you try to approximate it? If you do try and approximate it, what way is most appropriate? A simple mean, a linear regression model, a naive forecast, the mean, the mode? It really just depends on your data. As with many things in the realm of data science, it just depends on the data and you as the scientist have to make a decision based on the information you have available to you. Get creative and do lots of reading, learning is key to figuring out a workable direction to move with regards to imputation. There often isn't a \"right\" answer, it's typically a set of good answers that require understanding of the limitations of each of the possible choices.\n",

Given that we wanted to acess one particular column (age) under a certain scenario (female/child and null, male/child and null, etc), loc was appropriate to use and allowed us to set a value for all of these rows in the age column in one line. Check out the next cell and you'll see what I mean by a boolean array. The idea is to create a set of True and False values, indicating that we only want to keep the rows that are returned as True."
