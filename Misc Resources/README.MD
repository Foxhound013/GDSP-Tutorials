# Miscellaneous 
This section of the course page will be used for various resources and information that don't quite fit in any one particular tutorial. I've compiled some useful tooling that won't be mentioned in the main tutorials as well as links to various other tutorials or works that you may find helpful in your journey.

## Potentially Useful Tools
The following items are some tools that you may find useful in your time working with Python.

- PyCharm: This is a full fledged IDE (Integrated Development Environment). I've worked with it some and its an excellent tool. The community edition lacks the ability to SSH into remote servers and work on the code remotely though. For projects on a personal machine though, I can't recommend it enough. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
- VS Code: Visual Studio Code is a text editor by microsoft. You can configure this tool with a slew of extensions (some of which I will try to cover in one of our sessions). You can work on a multitude of languages with this text editor and SSH into one of the campus clusters to work on your code remotely. https://code.visualstudio.com/

## General Resources
Any resources that don't have a clear home in the following tutorials that I still think are useful will reside here.

- If you want to use a desktop session for Purdue's clusters, I'd recommend using the thinlinc client. It tends to be a little smoother than running it from a browser. https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download

## Python Basics
After speaking with some of those in the course, it seemed good to me to include some more general resources for learning Python. If you've never picked up Python before checkout the following links. Use as little or as much of each of these as you feel is necessary. The goal of these resources is to get you up to speed on how to write Python code at all. Some of these can be a little slow but if you stick with them, I'm sure you'll learn what you need to get off the ground.

- A tutorial from freecodecamp on starting out with Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw
- Information on Python Packages: https://pypi.org/

- Interactive online tutorials/practice:
  - Datacamp is chalk full of excellent tutorials tailored for Data Science. They teach quite a few tutorials on Python and R: https://www.datacamp.com
  - Dataquest is much like datacamp in that it is tailored to data science: https://app.dataquest.io/today
  - There are a plethora of nanodegrees out there for Python, here is one: https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104
  - Codecademy is the place many have gotten started learning a language for the first time: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python
  - HackerRank is a great resource for learning Python basics. It has tons of code tests to try out, all of which are labeled with a difficulty. For better or worse, many employers use this sort of test to determine whether or not to bring you in for an in person interview. Practice here will definitely help you out in those areas and should provide plenty of fodder for self study: https://www.hackerrank.com
  - LeetCode is pretty similar to HackerRank. If you're looking to challenge yourself on algorithms or get practice with feedback, this is a good go to: https://leetcode.com

- A condensed list of basic syntax and commands: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm

- A cheatsheet of the commands commonly used in Python: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/cheatsheet/python-cheat-sheets
