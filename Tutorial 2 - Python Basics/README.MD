# Tutorial 2 - Python Basics
Welcome to the second tutorial in this series. In this section we're going to cover the basics of getting up to speed using Python. In this tutorial we'll cover the following . . . 
 - Variables
 - Data Types
 - If/Else Statements
 - Loops (for and while)
 - Functions
 - List comprehensions
 - Lambdas

 If you're looking at that list and thinking that it sounds like a lot for a single tutorial, you'd be right! Feel free to split this section into two parts and work on them over the course of a week or two. From the section on Functions and on starts some of the more advanced basics so you could consider that a good break point here.
