# Tutorial 2 - Python Basics
Welcome to the second tutorial in this series. In this section we're going to cover the basics of getting up to speed using Python. In this tutorial we'll cover the following . . . 
 - Variables
 - Data Types
 - If/Else Statements
 - Loops (for and while)
 - Functions
 - Methods
 - Lambdas
 - Data Structures
 - List comprehensions

 If you're looking at that list and thinking that it sounds like a lot for a single tutorial, you'd be right! Feel free to split this section into three parts and work on them over the course of a two or three weeks (in fact these will already be split into three different notebooks).

 From this point forward, a lot of the material will be taught through Jupyter Notebooks but these README docs are still going to introduce the material and provide supplemental information along the way.

## Additional Resources
There is an absolutely astounding amount of information out there for learning to program in Python. I strongly encourage you to look around and see what else is out there as far as learning the Python basics. This single section in this series could be an entire series or semester all on its own. To help you get started finding resources elsewhere I've included some extra resources. The goal of these resources is to get you up to speed on how to get started writing Python code. Some of these can be a little slow but if you stick with them, I'm confident you'll learn a lot!

- Information on Python Packages: https://pypi.org/

- Interactive online tutorials/practice:

    - Datacamp is chalk full of excellent tutorials tailored for Data Science. They teach quite a few tutorials on Python and R: https://www.datacamp.com
    - Dataquest is much like datacamp in that it is tailored to data science: https://app.dataquest.io/today
    - There are a plethora of nanodegrees out there for Python, here is one: https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104
    - Codecademy is the place many have gotten started learning a language for the first time: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python
    - HackerRank is a great resource for learning Python basics. It has tons of code tests to try out, all of which are labeled with a difficulty. For better or worse, many employers use this sort of test to determine whether or not to bring you in for an in person interview. Practice here will definitely help you out in those areas and should provide plenty of fodder for self study: https://www.hackerrank.com
    - LeetCode is pretty similar to HackerRank. If you're looking to challenge yourself on algorithms or get practice with feedback, this is a good go to: https://leetcode.com
