This lession isn't going to be an all encompassing fast track to knowing everything about the basics of Python but hopefully will serve as a good starting point for your work in the future. For those of you that already know other languages quite well or are a little familiar with Python already, feel free to skim as much or as little of this as you like."

The definitions isn't any different in Python, variables are simply a container for some data. This data can be anything you want it to be, a string, a number, a list of items (strings or numbers), and a variety of other things. Let's do some quick examples."

This tells Python that n isn't simply a character but a special character in this case."
