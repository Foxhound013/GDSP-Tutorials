    "Functions are reusable bits of code that are intended to be used for a specific task. When you write a function it's a good idea to try to keep its purpose limited to one thing. For example if you have to say this function does this thing **and** this other thing, you may want to consider splitting it up. This is a tricky balance to keep but you'll get better at it and understand it a little better with a lot more reading and practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, let's see how to create a function in Python. We're going to keep it super simple here and make a function to add two numbers together. In this function we will require two parameters num1 and num2. After we run the function successfully, we'll see what happens if we don't provide a parameter or if we provide an incompatable parameter that the function didn't expect."
