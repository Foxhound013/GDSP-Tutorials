# Welcome to the GDSP Python Tutorial
This is the second iteration of this course. Version one and all of its associated course materials can be found in the CourseV1-2019 folder. This updated version of the course will include significant updates to the curriculum to be much more complete than what the original course scope allowed for. It is my hope that this repository will be a significant help to you in your journey to learn and use Python in your studies/research, career, and so much more. I hope you enjoy this course and if you notice any mistakes (I'm sure you will), take a crack at correcting these errors by submitting a pull request. You'll learn from making these corrections and benefit the community using these tutorials as well!

This course was developed in collaboration with Jiayuan Huang, Jiayuan has provided much of the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) content.

Please note that the tutorial materials are located in their respective folders and are numbered in the sequence they are intended to be done. Unfortunately GitHub sorts them out of order and to my knowledge there isn't a good way to fix this without switching to an alphabetic tutorial naming scheme (i.e. Tutorial A, Tutorial B, etc). To those of you that find this bothersome (like myself), I sincerely apologize, now on with the show. :shipit:

## Disclaimer
Programming doesn't come as a second nature to most of us despite what it might seem when you look around at your peers. Learning a new programming language takes a lot of effort, time, and most importantly practice. Don't get down on yourself because you have to search something that feels relatively trivial every 30 seconds or so, it's all part of the learning process. In my experience, it takes about a month to two months of consistent every day work (over a 5 day work week, I don't mean 24 hours a day 7 days a week here) to really start to get the hang of things. At that two month mark you'll start to feel a lot more comfortable with the language you're working in and have a rough idea of how to do a lot of things that were very challenging at the start. Keep coding, keep improving, and don't forget to take breaks from the computer! Sometimes stepping away and coming back to a problem later is all that you need to figure it out.

One final note on problem solving in your code, I've found that if I'm really stuck it can be profoundly beneficial to talk through the problem at hand with my wife. She doesn't program in any way shape or form but she can listen and ask questions. I owe many of my solved problems to her and her outside perspective.

Enough with the disclaimers, let's get to the course!

# Course Structure
This course will take you from the basics of Python programming to some of the basics of machine learning (ML) and deap learning (DL) in Python. The course outline can be seen below.

This content outline is subject to change.


1. Getting Started with Python - Installation of Anaconda and Managing Virtual Environments.
2. Python Basics - Something like a typical introduction to programming.
3. Python Visualization with Seabornes - Seabornes is built on Matplotlib but acts a little more like lattice and has some other creature comforts built in.
4. Python Data Stack 1 - Numpy and Scipy, get the students used to working with vectorized operations in Python.
5. Python Data Stack 2 - Pandas dataframes and the many functions built into pandas (include short bit pointing students to xarray for larger datasets)
6. Python Mapping - Still not sure of where to locate this one but here will do for now.
7. Pulling Together the Basics - A mini project using everything up to this point.
8. Stepping Toward ML/Modeling - An intro to sci-kit learn.
9. A Mini Project with sci-kit learn.
10. An Introduction to Tensorflow (Jiayuan)
11. Tensorflow Part 2 (Jiayuan)
12. Final Project - Pulling it all together.
