# GDSP-Tutorials
This repository serves as a home for all tutorials developed by myself for Purdue's GeoData Science for Professionals (GDSP) Masters of Science Program. The tutorials and order in which they are to be taught can be found below.

## Potentially Useful Tools
The following items are some tools that you may find useful in your time working with Python.

- PyCharm: This is a full fledged IDE (Integrated Development Environment). I've worked with it some and its an excellent tool. The community edition lacks the ability to SSH into remote servers and work on the code remotely though. For projects on a personal machine though, I can't recommend it enough. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
- VS Code: Visual Studio Code is a text editor by microsoft. You can configure this tool with a slew of extensions (some of which I will try to cover in one of our sessions). You can work on a multitude of languages with this text editor and SSH into one of the campus clusters to work on your code remotely. https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1 - Introduction to Anaconda and Git
See the corresponding folder for the slide deck. I've included an excellent crash course on Git below. Don't stress too much about the many commands you can use with Git. Get the basics down and you'll learn the other commands as you need them.
