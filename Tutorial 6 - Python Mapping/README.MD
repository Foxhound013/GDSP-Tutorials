# Tutorial 6 - Python Mapping
Welcome to the sixth tutorial in this series. This is somewhat of a return to visualization but this time we've got a few more tools and its time to start dealing with some geographic information. It's very likely that you have some geospatial data you'll want to work with in Python. This tutorial will give you the tools to get started with that!

If you have a lot of GIS type tasks to do, I'd recommend checking out the following link as it has a lot of libraries that you might find useful in that regard. https://gisgeography.com/python-libraries-gis-mapping/.

There are two major mapping libraries in Python, Basemap and Cartopy. Basemap has been deprecated in favor of Cartopy. We will cover some of the basics of cartopy in hopes of making it that much quicker for you to pick up and use in your own work!
