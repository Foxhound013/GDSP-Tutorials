The point here is to make you aware of these structures and some of their uses and methods so that you can take them and apply them to your own work. Until you apply these structures for yourself, you won't learn much.\n",

    "The following is true of lists:\n",
    "- They are ordered.\n",
    "- They are mutable (i.e. you can change the elements in the list).\n",
    "- You can mix and match data types (i.e. strings, floats, classes, you name it can all live in harmony in the same list).\n",
    "  - While you **can** mix and match data types. Its a good idea to keep your lists homogenous. That is to say, keep the same data types in one list. Once you start mixing data types, you might want to consider a different data structure.\n",
